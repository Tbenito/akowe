# Akọ̀wé

Akọ̀wé (Yoruba word for a clerk) is a serverless version of [Kotype](https://github.com/webodf/Kotype), a web-based collaborative real-time editing server for OpenDocuments.
Akọ̀wé uses static web pages hosted here on Github does not require a server to be configured to work. Instead, it uses a standard public JitsiMeet like (meet.jit.si) or Openfire Meetings service with an XMPP multi-user chat service to handle route messages betweeen all collaborating editors.

This means that Akọ̀wé can also provide a messaging, audio and video-conferencing service for the collaboration.
