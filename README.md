# Akọ̀wé

Akọ̀wé (Yoruba word for a clerk) is a serverless version of [Kotype](https://github.com/webodf/Kotype), a web-based collaborative real-time editing server for OpenDocuments.
Akọ̀wé uses static web pages hosted here on Github does not require a server to be configured to work. Instead, it uses a standard public XMPP server extended with [Colibri](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0340.html) like [Jitsi-Meet](https://meet.jit.si) or [Openfire Meetings](https://github.com/igniterealtime/openfire-ofmeet-plugin) with XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC) to handle route messages betweeen all collaborating editors.

This means that Akọ̀wé can also provide a messaging, audio and video-conferencing service for the collaboration.
