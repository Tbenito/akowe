# Akọ̀wé

Akọ̀wé (Yoruba word for a clerk) is a serverless version of [Kotype](https://github.com/webodf/Kotype), a web-based collaborative real-time editing server for [OpenDocuments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) (an open, XML-based file format specification for office applications) using [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) (a communication protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML).

Akọ̀wé uses static web pages hosted here on Github or any basic web server and does not require any server-side code to be installed and configured to work. No PHP, no Java, no NodeJS, just serveless with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript!!.

Akọ̀we requires a standard public XMPP server extended with [Colibri](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0340.html) like [Jitsi-Meet](https://meet.jit.si) or [Openfire Meetings](https://github.com/igniterealtime/openfire-ofmeet-plugin) together with standard XMPP Multi-User Chat (MUC) to provide audio conferencing and service the collaborative editing of text documents.

Nothing to install!. It is is serverless. Just clone this GitHub repository and enabled GitPages for the docs folder. 

## How to use
First edit index.js and change the default settings in kotypeGlobals. Next, open two browser window/tabs instances and point them at the github.io URL of your clone.
